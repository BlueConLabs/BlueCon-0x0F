###🔌 Talk + Workshop Title:
Deciphering Command Line Obfuscation & Threat Hunting APTs with KQL - Zero to Hero
Speaker: Jamie Eccleston, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst – AEMO (Threat Hunter at TrustWave - SpiderLabs)
📘 Speaker Bio:
Jamie Eccleston is a cyber threat intelligence analyst and threat hunter at the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). He began his career as a penetration tester after achieving his OSCP certification and later moved into intelligence and hunting roles. Jamie has developed and led threat hunting programs to counter state-sponsored threats, built custom data analytics tools, and currently specialises in Microsoft’s Kusto Query Language (KQL), widely used across Azure and Defender XDR for advanced hunting operations.

**🧠 Event Overview:**
This unique session will blend a live talk with hands-on threat hunting to explore command line obfuscation techniques and practical detection using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
Participants will set up their own free Azure Data Explorer clusters, upload threat datasets, and hunt for APT activity—learning to think like an adversary while applying powerful detection techniques.
The case study focus will be on Volt Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored group targeting critical infrastructure. You'll learn to pivot across artefacts like certutil and Event ID 4624 abuse, applying filtering, regex, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping to uncover hidden attacker  behaviour.
This is not just theory. It's real-world skill-building.
All attendees need is a laptop with internet access and at least 8GB of RAM.

**🔧 Hands-On Workshop:**
Zero to Hero: Threat Hunting APTs with Azure Data Explorer & KQL
Workshop Objectives:
Understand the principles of threat hunting and how it differs from IoC sweeping
Deploy and configure a free Azure Data Explorer cluster
Upload and navigate hunting datasets
Learn KQL fundamentals: filtering, parsing, regex, and obfuscation decoding
Investigate Volt Typhoon case study and command line activity
Apply MITRE ATT&CK for mapping techniques
Learning Outcomes: Attendees will:
Build confidence in threat hunting workflows
Analyse obfuscated command lines
Use KQL effectively to detect and respond to attacker behaviour
Understand the mindset needed to identify malicious activity hiding in plain sight
Learn anomaly hunting strategies using KQL
